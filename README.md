# Class Components React

Just a basic app to get a little practice and better understanding of "the old way" of using only class components in React. Based on ZTM's Monster Rolodex, but changed in looks, features and content to be a Pokédex, calling on pokeapi.co API.

## Using

- React (v18.2.0)
- React Router (v6)
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
