# Class Components React

Just a simple app to get a little practice and better understanding of "the old way" of using class components in React. Based on ZTM's Monster Rolodex, but changed in looks, features and content to be a Pokédex, calling on pokeapi.co API and also including React Router. The end result showcases how to create and work with class components to manage state, pass props, and get URL parameters for dynamic routing.

## Tools

- React (v18.2.0)
- React Router (v6)
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
